# Minimum Vertex Cover Solution

In this repository, I share an alogirthm that identifies the smallest number of variables in a dataframe that must be removed in order for there to be no two variables absolutely correlated with each other above some user defined cutoff. My cousin <a href=https://github.com/guskasper>Gus Kasper</a> helpfully pointed out that solving this problem is equivalent to solving the np complete <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_cover>minimum vertex cover problem</a>, so I decided to make this repository exclusively about this function, as opposed to lumping this function in with other data cleaning functions.

I personally used this function to remove near duplicate data before carrying out principal component analysis in order to not artificially skew the rankings of the resultant principal components. Removing highly correlated variables that hardly add any new information is a good idea in any case, both for the sake of being able to conduct analysis with a more manageable dataset and for the sake of avoiding overfitting. The function is also flexible in the sense that any measure of similarity (such as two variables having some high proportion of values that are identical) can be substituted for correlation, and the function will ensure that the smallest number of variables are removed subject to such a measure ceasing to exist between any two variables.

Details on the function, its logical justification, and its relation to the minimum vertex cover problem can be found in the pdf file in this repository, whereas The actual function and its subsidiary functions are defined in this repository's jupyter notebook.
